#Users API

This is a simple API for managing users profiles on SociaLink. It uses Node.js, Typescript, Express, and PostgreSQL. 

My approach was to use render.com to create a PostgreSQL database and input users through the terminal. Then, I stored my data and created get and pull requests that interacted with the frontend, allowing the data to be seen on the website.

Overall, I learned how to use SQL, databases, privacy, and connect the backend with the frontend. I struggled with using TypeScript as I never have before, but it made a lot of sense as I learned more about it.
